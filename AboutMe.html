                        I worked as a software developer for one year and 11 months ten years ago. Then, I pursued my career as a devoted mother for eight years.
                        During my software developer role, I accomplished these tasks:<br><br>

                       1) Two years of experience in development in a client-facing team.<br>
                       2) Developed a library application using .Net for an interview in the UK (in 2017), impressing the panel and myself even after a long break.<br>
                       3) Worked on creating requirement documents on CRM <br>
                       4) Develop new features in CRM on .NET <br><br>

                        Once I reached Australia in February 2021, I decided to try a job in my second interest area, which is teaching. <br>

                        I completed my Diploma and Certificate in Early Childhood education within a year. I started working as an Assistant educator, and just after one and a half years got promoted to the leadership role. I am currently working as a Lead Educator.
