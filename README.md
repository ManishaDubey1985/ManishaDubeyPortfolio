## Technologies Used
-	HTML5
      -	The project uses HTML5 to create the basic elements and content of my website.
-	CSS3
      -	The project uses CSS3 to add custom styles to the elements and content of my website.
-	Bootstrap v4.3
      -	The project uses Bootstrap v4.3 to add a responsive grid system, prebuilt components, plugins built on jQuery, and Bootstrap styles to my website, before adding my custom styles.
-	JavaScript
      -	The project uses JavaScript from Bootstrap which is required to add functionality to some of Bootstrap's components.
-	Git
      -	I've used Git as a version control system to regularly add and commit changes made to project in Cloud9, before pushing them to GitHub.
-	GitHub
      -	I've used GitHub as a remote repository to push and store the committed changes to my project from Git. I've also used GitHub pages to deploy my website in a live environment.

### Testing
-	Tested all the pages on different devices and working fine.
-	While testing through GIT pages website, the post method not working on the contact form submission and getting the error ‘405 NOT Allowed’.
-	Through my research, I found that it is not supported by GITHUB.

## Deployment

The hosting platform that I've used for my project is GitHub Pages. To deploy my website to GitHub pages, I used the following steps:

1.	Created the repository on the GITHUB named: ManishaDubeyPortfolio
2.	Initialised Git using the `git init` command.
3.	Cloned repository using `git clone` ManishaDubeyPortfolio
4.	Created working and Portfolio branch using `git checkout -b` command
5.	Created files in the working directory.
6.	Added all files to the Staging area (Git) using the `git add .` command.
7.	Committed the files to Git using the `git commit -m` with various messages as the files are modified
8.	Pushed the code to working branch using git push origin working
9.	After unit testing created a pull request on Git hub to merge the tested working branch code to Portfolio branch
10.	Created Git pages using the Portfolio branch
11.	Went into 'Settings' on my repository page in GitHub.
12.	Ran several regular commits throughout my project.
13. The project is awaited for UAT clearance under the Portfolio branch.
14. Once done, it will be pushed to the main branch for final launch of webesite.
